This is the new home for team 751's 2012 and later robot code.
History of this code is available in our old Google Code project at http://code.google.com/p/team751robotcode/.

Besides a Netbeans installation with the FRC java plugins, this code assumes some things:
* A cRIO-FRC or cRIO-FRCII with a 2012 or later image and all the modules in the default slots
* Team 751's 2012 robot
